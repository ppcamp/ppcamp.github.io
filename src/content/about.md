Hi, my name is Pedro Augusto C Santos, I’m graduating in Computer Engineering college in Unifei — Campus Itabira. I’m focusing in my programming and teaching skills.

## Programmer
My objective as a developer it’s impulsionate and divulgate the open source community — empahisis in linux based distributions and dev tools similars. The current areas that I’m interested for it’s: Big Data, Web Scrapers and automatization process, and Back-end part at General.

Part of my motivation it’s because of idea that I have which the knowledge must be shared, and the second one it’s “don’t make the wheel”, so those two bases define who I’m/pretend to be as a profissional in this area.

## Teacher
As a teacher, if I follow this way, I pretend to teach ‘bout themes like programming or mathemathics.
