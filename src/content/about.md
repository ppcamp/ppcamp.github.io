_The Hunchback of Notre-Dame_ (French: _Notre-Dame de Paris_) is a French Romantic/Gothic novel by Victor Hugo, published in 1831. The original French title refers to Notre Dame Cathedral, on which the story is centered. English translator Frederic Shoberl named the novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1833 because at the time, Gothic novels were more popular than Romance novels in England. The story is set in Paris, France in the Late Middle Ages, during the reign of Louis XI.


Hi, my name is Pedro Augusto C Santos, I’m graduating in Computer Engineering college in Unifei — Campus Itabira. I’m focusing in my programming and teaching skills.

## Programmer
My objective as a developer it’s impulsionate and divulgate the open source community — empahisis in linux based distributions and dev tools similars. The current areas that I’m interested for it’s: Big Data, Web Scrapers and automatization process, and Back-end part at General.

Part of my motivation it’s because of idea that I have which the knowledge must be shared, and the second one it’s “don’t make the wheel”, so those two bases define who I’m/pretend to be as a profissional in this area.

## Teacher
As a teacher, if I follow this way, I pretend to teach ‘bout themes like programming or mathemathics.
